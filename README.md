# **Shiba Petting Game**

This is my own clicker game. Used cookie clicker as an example for this game. In this game you will be petting the shiba for pet points and you can use those points to buy things that can get you more pet points. There are things that will increase the amount of points you get per pet and there are also things that can generate points with time.

# **Motivation**

Just wanted to create a simply game on the web and see if I can make it work. I was really into cookie clicker for a few days and decided to make this app and see if I can make something similar.

# **Build**

This is build just on React. There is no back-end so nothing is going to get saved. If you refesh the page, all progress will be lost.
